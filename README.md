## PR Size Handling Strategy

The `/review` command intelligently adapts to PR size:

| Size | Lines Changed | Strategy | Review Time |
|------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| üü¢ Small | < 200 | Complete detailed review | 15-30 min |
| üü° Medium | 200-500 | Detailed review with focus | 30-60 min |
| üü† Large | 500-1000 | Prioritized + sampling | 1-2 hours |
| üî¥ Very Large | > 1000 | Risk-based + split recommendation | 2-4 hours |

## Development Workflow

### When to Use These Commands

**Use `/review`, `/review-perf`, or `/review-sec` when**:
- ‚úÖ PR has passed all CI/CD checks (tests, lint, build).
- ‚úÖ PR description is complete and clear.
- ‚úÖ User Stories are linked (if applicable for `/review`).
- ‚úÖ The author has already self-reviewed the changes.

**Don't use them if**:
- ‚ùå CI/CD checks are failing.
- ‚ùå The PR is still in a draft state.
- ‚ùå There are merge conflicts.

### Recommended Workflow

1.  Author creates a PR.
2.  Automated checks run and pass ‚úÖ.
3.  Reviewer runs `/review <PR_NUMBER> [HU_URL]` for a holistic review, or a specialized command like `/review-perf` or `/review-sec`.
4.  The AI provides a comprehensive analysis.
5.  The reviewer validates the AI's findings and provides feedback on GitHub.
6.  The author addresses the feedback.
7.  Repeat as needed, then merge!
