# Claude Commands for Exito Store

Welcome! This repository contains custom Claude Desktop commands designed to streamline and enhance the development workflow for the FastStore/VTEX e-commerce platform at Exito.

## Available Commands

Here are the commands you can use to supercharge your Pull Request reviews.

### `/tech-review` - Advanced PR Review for FastStore/VTEX

**Purpose**: Provides a comprehensive technical review of Pull Requests, intelligently adapting its strategy to the size and complexity of the changes. It's optimized for the FastStore/VTEX platform and can integrate with Azure DevOps for business context.

**Quick Start**:
```bash
# Basic usage for a PR
/tech-review 1695

# For a PR with related User Story context from Azure DevOps
/tech-review 1695 https://dev.azure.com/grupo-exito/GCIT-Agile/_workitems/edit/544232
```

**Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ **Adaptive Strategy**: Automatically detects PR size (Small, Medium, Large, Very Large) and adjusts its review depth.
- ‚úÖ **FastStore/VTEX Compliance**: Checks for adherence to platform-specific standards, including UI components, styling, and multi-store compatibility.
- ‚úÖ **Business Context Validation**: Integrates with Azure DevOps to ensure the implementation aligns with user story requirements and acceptance criteria.
- ‚úÖ **Risk Assessment**: Identifies and categorizes issues by severity (Critical, Important, Minor) to prioritize fixes.
- ‚úÖ **Large PR Handling**: Employs advanced techniques like domain grouping, prioritized file review, and pattern-based analysis for large and complex PRs.
- ‚úÖ **Actionable Recommendations**: Provides clear next steps, testing strategies, and post-deployment monitoring plans.

### `/code-quality-review` - Code Quality & Performance Review

**Purpose**: Performs an in-depth analysis of code quality, performance, and adherence to clean code principles. This command is ideal for a deep-dive into React, Next.js, and general web development best practices.

**Quick Start**:
```bash
# Basic usage for a PR
/code-quality-review 1695

# For a PR with multiple related User Stories
/code-quality-review 1695 <AZURE_DEVOPS_URL_1> <AZURE_DEVOPS_URL_2>
```

**Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ **Performance Deep-Dive**: Analyzes React hooks, Next.js data fetching (`getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`), image optimization, and general web performance patterns.
- ‚úÖ **Design Pattern Analysis**: Identifies the use of design patterns (Hooks, Provider, Factory, etc.) and suggests opportunities for architectural improvements.
- ‚úÖ **Clean Code Evaluation**: Checks for adherence to principles like KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and identifies common code smells.
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript & Type Safety**: Reviews TypeScript usage, flagging `any` types, type assertions, and other potential safety issues.
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing Review**: Assesses test coverage, quality, and strategy for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- ‚úÖ **Security & Accessibility**: Performs a quick scan for common security vulnerabilities (like XSS) and accessibility (a11y) issues.

## PR Size Handling Strategy

The `/tech-review` command intelligently adapts to PR size:

| Size | Lines Changed | Strategy | Review Time |
|------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| üü¢ Small | < 200 | Complete detailed review | 15-30 min |
| üü° Medium | 200-500 | Detailed review with focus | 30-60 min |
| üü† Large | 500-1000 | Prioritized + sampling | 1-2 hours |
| üî¥ Very Large | > 1000 | Risk-based + split recommendation | 2-4 hours |

## Development Workflow

### When to Use These Commands

**Use `/tech-review` or `/code-quality-review` when**:
- ‚úÖ PR has passed all CI/CD checks (tests, lint, build).
- ‚úÖ PR description is complete and clear.
- ‚úÖ User Stories are linked (if applicable).
- ‚úÖ The author has already self-reviewed the changes.

**Don't use them if**:
- ‚ùå CI/CD checks are failing.
- ‚ùå The PR is still in a draft state.
- ‚ùå There are merge conflicts.

### Recommended Workflow

1.  Author creates a PR.
2.  Automated checks run and pass ‚úÖ.
3.  Reviewer runs `/tech-review <PR_NUMBER> [HU_URL]` for a holistic review or `/code-quality-review <PR_NUMBER> [HU_URL]` for a deep code quality check.
4.  The AI provides a comprehensive analysis.
5.  The reviewer validates the AI's findings and provides feedback on GitHub.
6.  The author addresses the feedback.
7.  Repeat as needed, then merge!
